# Data Engineering Assignment (SteelEye Internship)

This repository is created as a submission of my assignment for the role of Data Engineer Intern at SteelEye. 

So the basic aim of this project is to download and extract some *.xml* files present in the given *"select.xml"* file and then store some data from those files into a *.csv* file.






## Assignment Flow

1. Initially we have only *"select.xml"* file, which has some web links to some more *.zip* files.
2. These *.zip* file, containing a *.xml* file, needs to be downloaded and extracted.
3. Every *.xml* file has some contents, which we need to store in a *.csv* file




## Lessons Learned
